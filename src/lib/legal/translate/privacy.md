# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 10, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Voicely Translate Discord bot ("Voicely Translate," the "Bot," or the "Service").

## Overview

Voicely Translate provides live voice transcription and translation within Discord. To provide the Service, the Bot processes certain Discord information, voice audio, generated transcripts and translations, server configuration information, usage information, and information associated with credit purchases.

This policy describes the categories of information involved, why they are processed, and the third-party services that may receive information as part of providing the Service.

## Information Processed by the Service

Depending on how the Bot is used, Voicely Translate may process:

### Discord Information

- Discord server (guild) IDs.
- Discord user IDs.
- Voice channel and text/channel identifiers needed to provide Bot functionality.
- Discord display information needed to attribute a transcription or translation to the appropriate speaker.
- Server configuration, such as selected/default translation languages and idle-timeout settings.

### Voice Audio

When Voicely Translate is active in a voice channel, the Bot receives voice audio needed to detect speech and create transcriptions.

Audio may be temporarily buffered or processed as necessary to provide the Service.

### Transcriptions and Translations

Speech may be converted into text and sent for automated transcription and translation processing. Generated transcriptions and translations may then be posted into Discord.

Once text is posted in Discord, Discord's own storage, retention, permissions, and deletion behavior applies to that message.

### Usage and Credit Information

The Service may process and store the following information to track usage, manage credits, and process credit purchases:

- Purchased and promotional/free-trial credit balances.
- Total usage amounts and calculated usage costs.
- Separate transcription and translation usage totals.
- Trial usage and remaining trial balance.
- Discord server IDs.
- Server-specific `VT-XXXXXX` top-up codes.
- Ko-fi transaction or message IDs used to identify payments and prevent duplicate credit activation.
- Purchase amounts and currency.
- Ko-fi Shop item identifiers used to verify that a purchase is for Voicely Translate Credits.
- Whether a payment has already been claimed and applied to a Discord server.

A server-specific `VT-XXXXXX` top-up code is associated with a Discord server ID. When that code is included with a qualifying Ko-fi purchase, the Service uses it to determine which Discord server should receive the purchased credits.

### Purchase Information

When credits are purchased through Ko-fi, the Service receives information included in Ko-fi's webhook notification that is necessary to verify and process the purchase. This may include:

- The Ko-fi transaction/message ID.
- The purchase amount and currency.
- The purchased Shop item's identifier.
- The message included with the order.
- The server-specific `VT-XXXXXX` code contained in that message.

The `VT-XXXXXX` code is associated with a Discord server ID so that purchased credits can be assigned to the correct Discord server.

Payment-card and bank-account details are processed by Ko-fi and its payment providers and are not received or stored by Voicely Translate.

### Technical and Diagnostic Information

The Service may generate operational logs containing information needed to diagnose errors, maintain the Bot, detect abuse, and verify successful processing. Logs may include server IDs, channel IDs, user IDs, transaction/event identifiers, error messages, and service-status information.

## How Information Is Used

Information is processed to:

- Connect the Bot to Discord voice channels.
- Detect speech and distinguish speakers.
- Transcribe voice audio.
- Identify supported languages.
- Translate transcribed speech.
- Post transcriptions and translations to Discord.
- Maintain server settings.
- Track trial access and usage.
- Maintain and deduct Voicely Credit balances.
- Activate Ko-fi credit purchases.
- Prevent duplicate payment crediting.
- Diagnose failures and maintain reliability.
- Protect the Service against abuse, fraud, and unauthorized access.

## Third-Party Services

Voicely Translate depends on third-party services to operate. Information may be transmitted to these providers when necessary to provide the Service.

### Discord

Discord provides the servers, voice channels, user information, and messaging infrastructure through which Voicely Translate operates.

Messages posted by the Bot are handled according to Discord's systems and policies.

### OpenAI

Voice audio and/or text derived from voice activity may be sent to OpenAI services for automated transcription and translation.

The exact information sent depends on the feature being used.

### Ko-fi

Ko-fi may process purchases of Voicely Credits. Ko-fi sends transaction information to the Service so that qualifying purchases can be associated with a Discord server and converted into credits.

### Cloudflare

Cloudflare infrastructure may be used to receive Ko-fi webhook events, store or retrieve information required for credit activation, and provide communication between the Bot and the credit-processing service.

These providers operate under their own terms and privacy policies.

## Voice Audio Retention

Voicely Translate processes voice audio for the purpose of providing live transcription and translation.

The Service is not intended to maintain a permanent archive of users' voice recordings. Temporary audio files or buffers may exist during processing and are deleted or discarded when they are no longer required for the active processing workflow.

Third-party providers involved in processing may have their own retention practices, which are governed by their respective policies.

## Transcript and Translation Retention

Transcriptions and translations posted to Discord become Discord messages and may remain available in Discord according to the server's permissions, moderation practices, message deletion, and Discord's own policies.

The Service may temporarily hold generated text while processing a request. Operational logs may also contain limited text or error context when necessary for debugging, depending on the nature of an error.

Server administrators should manage Discord message history according to the privacy expectations of their communities.

## Stored Server and Credit Data

Certain information must persist so the Service can function between restarts. This may include:

- Discord server IDs.
- Server configuration, including idle-timeout settings and saved default translation languages.
- Remaining free-trial credit balances.
- Purchased credit balances.
- Total purchased-credit amounts.
- Total calculated usage.
- Separate transcription and translation usage totals.
- Server-specific `VT-XXXXXX` top-up codes.
- Payment-event identifiers and associated purchase amounts.
- Information required to prevent duplicate credit claims.

This information may be stored locally by the Bot and/or in infrastructure used for Ko-fi credit processing.

## Legal Basis and Consent

Depending on your location, privacy law may require a particular legal basis for processing personal information or consent from participants before voice communications are transcribed.

Server owners and administrators are responsible for determining whether they are permitted to enable Voicely Translate in a particular server or voice channel and for providing notices or obtaining consent where required.

Users should not use Voicely Translate to secretly transcribe or monitor conversations in violation of applicable law.

## Data Sharing

Information is not sold as part of operating Voicely Translate.

Information may be disclosed:

- To service providers when necessary to operate the Service.
- When required by applicable law, legal process, or a valid governmental request.
- When reasonably necessary to investigate fraud, abuse, security threats, or violations of applicable terms.
- In connection with a reorganization, transfer, or discontinuation of the Service, subject to applicable legal requirements.

## Data Security

Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to protect information handled by the Service. These may include authentication secrets, restricted API endpoints, and access controls.

No internet-connected service can guarantee absolute security. Users should not send sensitive information through Voicely Translate unless they are comfortable with that information being processed by the services required to provide transcription and translation.

## Data Retention

Persistent server, configuration (including saved default languages and idle-timeout settings), credit balances, purchase totals, usage totals, transcription/translation usage breakdowns, and transaction-deduplication information may be retained for as long as reasonably necessary to operate the Service, maintain accurate balances, prevent duplicate credits, resolve disputes, comply with legal obligations, and protect against abuse.

Temporary processing data is discarded when it is no longer required for the processing workflow.

Where third-party providers process information, their own retention policies may also apply.

## Your Choices and Requests

You can stop future processing by leaving a voice channel where the Bot is active, asking an authorized server administrator to disconnect the Bot, or removing the Bot from a server where you have permission to do so.

Depending on applicable law, you may have rights regarding personal information associated with you, such as rights to request access, correction, or deletion.

Requests should be sent through the contact method provided by the operator of Voicely Translate. Some information may need to be retained when required for security, fraud prevention, accounting, dispute resolution, or legal compliance.

Messages already posted to Discord may need to be managed through Discord and the relevant Discord server.

## Children's Privacy

Voicely Translate is intended to be used only by individuals permitted to use Discord and the other services required for the Bot. The Service is not intentionally designed to collect personal information from children in violation of applicable law.

## International Processing

Third-party services used by Voicely Translate may process information in countries other than the country where a user is located. Applicable provider policies and legal safeguards govern those processing activities.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as the Service changes. The "Last Updated" date at the top will be revised when changes are made.
